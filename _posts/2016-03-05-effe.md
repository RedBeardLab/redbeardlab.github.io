title: Introducing effe

## Historical Intro

In November 2014 AWS Lambda was released and it was nothing short than a revolution.

Provided a simple functions it lets developer run their code without provisioning or managing servers.

AWS takes care of all the necessary infrastructure.

The code is run as response to a trigger and it can be called concurrently thousands and thousands of times and keep scaling.

Unfortunately the implementation detail of AWS Lambda are proprietary, and the only way to takes advantage of such product is to use AWS, is not possible to change provider.

In February 2016 Google announce a competitor of AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Function, with the same functionality, unfortunately the software is still closed source.

## Introducing Effe

Today RedBeardLab is glad to announce the first version of [effe][effe], an open source project to provide the building block necessary to create "server-less" architecture without lock the developer inside any proprietary infrastructure.

`effe` is not the infrastructure, it is a small, completely customizable, go-lang package that, once compiled, need to run inside a bigger architecture, `effe` is the building block.

### Different premise of AWS Lambda

`effe` is been build on different premise than AWS Lambda.

* Isolation is not a real issues today, containers can provide complete isolation between runtimes and much more.

* It is preferable to have a binary idle on a machine waiting for input with a small memory footprint and no start-up time, than no memory footprint at all but  not-negligible start-up time.

* Open and close connections to databases and other service is expensive, it is not desiderable to open a new connection every time a function is invoked.

Based on this assumptions, after a lot of studying and thoughts, we come out with `effe`.

`effe` is build following the philosopy that perfection is reached when there is nothing left to eliminate, not when there is nothing more to add.

For this reason the code is extremely small, but it let you do at least the same of AWS Lambda.

### Developed in go

`effe` is been developed in go, we choose this languange for a variety of reason:

1.	First class support for concurrency: Write the `effe` code was easy, the code is small, clear and easily understandable.

2.	The go languange overall: go is backed by google and its main uses are web related services (eg. it already provides support for HTTP2), its syntax is understandable by most developer and it can produce a single, small executable.

3.	Garbage Collector: The performance of the go GC are interesting, on top of that most application written in `effe` are going to be I/O bounded, so the GC will not bother too much. On the other hand, not carefully managed memory, could cause big damages in this environment.


## effe-tool

Go is been written to simply construct complex system, so it is a little rigid when you try to do things in novel, not-standard way, as we did with `effe`.

It is possible to compile by hand a single effe, however is a little tricky and is necessary to know very well how the go compiler works.

To release this pain point we wrote a little command line utility, [effe-tool][effe-tool], that let you simply create a new effe and, more importantly, let you build it with a simple interface.

`effe-tool` is the best way to get started with `effe`.


## Not complete yet

The whole `effe` project is not complete yet.

It lack a simple and easy way to deploy, which is arguably one of the most important benefit of AWS Lambda.

However it is already usable and, with a little of DevOps experience, it can already provide infinitely scalable architecture.

The next milestone is to add "dockerization" capabilities to effe-tool, so that with a single command you can create a docker container, update it to your registry and have it ready to run in production.

For now we are trying to gather feedback from the community, we would love you to use our software to build your next project.

You can star the project on github, open issues, pull requests or subscribe to our maillist to be kept up to date.

If you subscribe (bottom right) you will also receive the "Little introduction to distributed, highly scalable, fault tollerant system."
